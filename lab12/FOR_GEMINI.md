## Current Task for Gemini

**Objective:** Integrate Preact Signals and Hooks from `preact_signals.ts` into `cleanroom_esm.js` within the `lab12` directory. The broader goal is to achieve functional parity with `lib/standalone.js`, leveraging the existing `lab10/app.js` and `lab10/index.html` as a testing harness.

**Project Understanding:** This project (`CLEANROOM.JS`) is an exploration of minimalist frontend development, intentionally avoiding `npm` and focusing on direct control over dependencies and the build process. The "clean-room" aspect involves re-implementing or re-assembling core functionalities from first principles for better understanding and customization.

**Status:** `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) is not available, so the integration will be performed manually. This involves:
1.  Manually converting `preact_signals.ts` content to plain JavaScript.
2.  Merging the converted code (including `Signal` class, `useSignal`, `useEffect`, and other hooks) into `cleanroom_esm.js`.
3.  Ensuring proper handling of imports/exports and internal dependencies (`options`, `SKIP_CHILDREN`).

**Next Step:** Await user's return in the context of `lab12` to proceed with the manual integration.
